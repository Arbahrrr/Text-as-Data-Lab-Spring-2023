For simplicity, suppose we have 2 speakers: $S_{c} = \{s,t\}$.

## Likelihood of Word Frequency from Data

For a speech $i$ by speaker $s$ and randomly chosen word $w$, the (log) probability that this word is $v \in V_{c}$ is
\begin{align}
\log Pr(w = v | s) = \eta_{sv}
\end{align}

Can get a speaker-specific vector $\eta_{s}$ for all words and speeches. 

## Posterior Probability of Authorship

Suppose we randomly pick a word type $v$ and a word token $w$ from speech $i$. Then, the posterior probability that speech $i$ is given by speaker $s$ 
\begin{align}
Pr(s | w=v) = \frac{Pr(w=v | s) \times Pr(s)}{Pr(w=v | s) \times Pr(s) + Pr(w=v | t) \times Pr(t)}
\end{align}

## Measure of Distinctiveness

Intuition: distinctive speaker if we can determine speaker's authorship of a given speech with relatively high probability (i.e. high posterior probability)

With equal prior probabilities for whether $s$ or $t$ is the speaker of a speech $i$, we can obtain the posterior log-odds of authorship for speech $i$ for a word type $v$ and token $w$ as:
\begin{align}
\log \left(\frac{Pr(s | w=v)}{Pr(t | w=v)}\right) = \log \left(\frac{Pr(w=v| s) \times Pr(s)}{Pr(w=v | t) \times Pr(t)}\right) = \log \left(\frac{Pr(w=v | s)}{Pr(w=v | t)}\right) = \eta_{sv} - \eta_{tv}
\end{align}

The expected value across word types and word tokens of this is the _distinctiveness of speaker s_ for speech $i$ (with $x_i$ being the number of word tokens in speech $i$ equal to $v$ and $n_i$ being the length of speech $i$):
\begin{align}
E\left(\log \left(\prod_{w\in n_i} \prod_{v\in V_c} Pr(s|w) - Pr(t | w) \right) \right) = \frac{1}{n_i} \sum_{v\in V_c} x_{iv} (\eta_{sv} - \eta_{tv})
\end{align}

This can be generalized to larger reference speaker sets and larger number of speeches. See [Huang, L., Perry, P., & Spirling, A. (2020).
